# Hey there, I am Rouvik Maji! ðŸ‘‹
Aspiring Software Engineer | Low Level Programmer | OS & Emulator Enthusiast

I love exploring the intersection of low-level systems, computer architecture, and software engineering. From building custom operating systems and emulators to diving into compilers, networking, and reverse engineering â€” I'm always up for a challenge that pushes me closer to the metal.

## About me:
Hi, I'm Rouvik Maji â€” a passionate student and aspiring software engineer who loves building things from scratch and diving deep into how systems work.

I explore a wide range of technologies and languages including JavaScript, Node.js, HTML/CSS, Java, C++, and more. While I started with web development, my interests have grown into areas like systems programming, OS development, emulators, and low-level architecture.

I prefer working on a few meaningful projects at a time, often experimenting and learning as I go. Whether itâ€™s crafting a web app with Node.js or writing a kernel in Assembly, Iâ€™m always excited to learn something new and push my limits.

ðŸ›  Always building. Always learning.
